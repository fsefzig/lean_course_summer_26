Your first task is to prove lemmas 0-3 from the lecture notes.

section -- More on divisiblity

theorem exercise1 {d n : ℕ} (hd : d ≠ 1) (h : d ∣ n) : ¬ (d ∣ n + 1):= by

theorem infinitely_many_primes : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p > n := by
  intro n

section -- Finsets

#check Finset ℕ -- the type of finite subsets of ℕ

variable {α : Type} [DecidableEq α] -- we need to be able to decide equality of elements

#check Finset α -- the type of finite sets formed by terms of type α

/-
A very useful feature of the Finset type is that we can perform induction over |I|.
This works similarly to induction over ℕ. Use #check to find out how it works.

#check Finset.induction_on

-- We can sum over finite sets, using the ∑ notation.
variable {I : Finset α} {f : α → ℕ}

#check ∑ i ∈ I, f i


-- Use what we learned to prove the following theorem.
theorem exercise3 (d : ℕ) (h : ∀ x, d ∣ f x) : d ∣ ∑ i ∈ I, f i := by
  apply Finset.dvd_sum
  intro i _
  exact h i
end

Open question: Think about the following question:
How can we formalize the prime factorization theorem in Lean?
What would be the type of the decomposition of a natural number into its prime factors?
How can you state the theorem that every natural number has a (unique) prime factorization?
How would you prove it?
