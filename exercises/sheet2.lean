/-I'm not sure if I was supposed to use these facts from the library.
The only other way I can think of to do this involves using induction with a non-zero base case.
I will include that proof below.-/

/-Transparency: During this proof, I had ChatGPT help me learn the syntax required for this line 34 and 35.
I also used it to remind me how to split \and using rcases. I also used it for some other syntax and stuff.
The proof is based on Euclid's approach. The rest was all apply? exact?!
I tried to avoid using ChatGPT too much, and I think I did a pretty good job (I only used it when I was really confused).-/

section -- Finsets

#check Finset ℕ -- the type of finite subsets of ℕ

variable {α : Type} [DecidableEq α] -- we need to be able to decide equality of elements

#check Finset α -- the type of finite sets formed by terms of type α

/-
A very useful feature of the Finset type is that we can perform induction over |I|.
This works similarly to induction over ℕ. Use #check to find out how it works.

-- We can sum over finite sets, using the ∑ notation.
variable {I : Finset α} {f : α → ℕ}

#check ∑ i ∈ I, f i


-- Use what we learned to prove the following theorem.

Open question: Think about the following question:
How can we formalize the prime factorization theorem in Lean?
What would be the type of the decomposition of a natural number into its prime factors?
How can you state the theorem that every natural number has a (unique) prime factorization?
How would you prove it?
