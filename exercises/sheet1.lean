variable {T : Type} {P : T → Prop}

/-
Recall a proof of a universally quantified statement ∀ x, P x
is an object of the product type ∏ (x : T), P x. In other words, a proof of ∀ x, P x
is a function that takes an arbitrary element x of type T and returns a proof of P x.
Thus, we can apply h : ∀ x, P x to an arbitrary element x : T to obtain a proof of P x.

theorem exercise3 (h : ∀ x, P x) (x : T) : P x := by
  exact h x


/-
Whenever we want to prove a universally quantified statement ∀ x, P x,
we can use the 'intro' tactic to introduce an element x of type T and change the goal to P x.

theorem theorem_we_want_to_use (x : T) : P x := by
  sorry -- use this theorem to prove exercise4

theorem exercise4 : ∀ x, P x := by
  intro x
  exact theorem_we_want_to_use x


/-
Recall a proof of an existentially quantified statement ∃ x, P x
is an object of the sum type ∑ (x : T), P x. In other words, a proof of ∃ x, P x is a pair (x, h)
where x : T and h : P x.
We can use the 'use x' tactic to prove an existentially quantified statement by providing a witness
x : T and changing the goal to P x.

theorem exercise5 (h : ∀ x, P x) (y : T) : ∃ y, P y := by
  use y
  exact h y





/-
Finally, to use a hypothesis h : ∃ x, P x, we can use the 'rcases' tactic to obtain
a witness x : T and a proof h' : P x.
