Use `continuousAt_iff_seqContinuousAt` for the exercise.
You may find `Function.comp_apply` useful when simplifying compositions.

Use the above lemma to prove that the sum of two continuous functions is continuous.

## Exercise 2: the least-upper-bound property
-/

/-
Do not use `sSup`, `le_csSup`, or `csSup_le` in this exercise. The aim is to
derive the least-upper-bound property from Cauchy completeness.

Use a bisection construction:

1) Choose `l₀ ∈ S` using `hS`, and choose an upper bound `u₀` using `hbdd`.
   Thus `l₀ ≤ u₀`.

2) Recursively bisect the interval `[lₙ, uₙ]`. Let
   `mₙ = (lₙ + uₙ) / 2`.

   * If `mₙ ∈ upperBounds S`, set `lₙ₊₁ = lₙ` and `uₙ₊₁ = mₙ`.
   * Otherwise, there is some `y ∈ S` with `mₙ < y`. Choose such a `y`,
     set `lₙ₊₁ = y`, and keep `uₙ₊₁ = uₙ`.

   You'll need `classical` to make these choices.

3) Prove by induction that:

   * `lₙ ∈ S`;
   * `uₙ ∈ upperBounds S`;
   * the intervals are nested; and
   * `uₙ - lₙ ≤ (u₀ - l₀) / 2^n`.

4) Deduce that `⟨l⟩ : RealSeq` is Cauchy. For sufficiently large `N`,
   every `lₙ` with `n ≥ N` lies in `[l_N, u_N]`, whose length tends to
   zero. The lemmas `exists_pow_lt_of_lt_one` and `one_half_lt_one` may
   help with the powers of `1 / 2`.

5) Apply `MySequences.real_numbers_complete` from last time to obtain a real number `a` to which
   `l` converges. This `a` will be the supremum; do not identify it with
   the library term `sSup S`.

6) Use the two lemmas above about limits to show that `a` satisfied the least-upper-bound property.
Hint: a is also the limit of the sequence `u`.

7) Prove the at least one of the lemmas about limits above.

    ∃ sup : upperBounds S, ∀ b : upperBounds S, sup ≤ b := by

Bonus! think about how to prove that every real number has a decimal expansion.
Hint: Use the floor function and look at `Σ'` and `HasSum`.
