# Exercise sheet 3: removing one prime power

In `examples4.lean`, `PExp n p` is the exponent of `p` in `n`.  The two
definitions below give names to the corresponding entries of
`Nat.maxPowDvdDiv`.  Thus `primeExponent n p` is the exponent of `p`, while
`remainder n p` is what remains after the full power of `p` has been removed.

The four exercises isolate the number-theoretic input needed for lemmas 1--4
in the lecture notes. You may find the results in `Nat.MaxPowDiv` useful.

Lecture lemma 2: after removing the largest power of `q`, every prime divisor of
`n` is either `q` itself or a prime divisor of the remainder.  The hypothesis
`q ∣ n` is the arithmetic content of saying that `q` lies in the support of
the prime factorization of `n`.

## Applications of prime factorization

For these exercises we use Mathlib's built-in `Nat.factorization`.  Its
support is the finite set of prime divisors, just like the support of `PExp`
constructed in the lecture.

The greatest common divisor `Nat.gcd n m` is the largest natural number that
divides both `n` and `m`.

The least common multiple `Nat.lcm n m` is the smallest natural number
divisible by both `n` and `m`.

Start by writing down the proofs on paper, and start by formalizing the key mathematical
facts you used in the proof as lemmas.
We will discuss set operations during the exercise class tomorrow!

/- The prime divisors of the least common multiple are exactly the prime
divisors occurring in either number.  The nonzero assumptions exclude the
special case in which `Nat.lcm n m = 0`. -/
